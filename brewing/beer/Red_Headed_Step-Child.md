## Notes

A witbier inspired 5 Gallon partial mash flavored with hibiscus and ginger. An original recipe Hibiscus and Ginger Wit with a rose cream head and partially opaque burgundy body. This large bodied beer has a mouth-feel typical of a Belgian style wit, a nose reminiscent of raspberry, along with a hibiscus wheat flavor with hinted with ginger, and a subtle earthy chamomile. It is anticipated that this ale will bottle age well assuming it lasts long enough to do so.
