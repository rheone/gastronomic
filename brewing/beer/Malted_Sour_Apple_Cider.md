# Malted Sour Apple Cider

A no boil malted cider based on EdWort's Apfelwein <http://www.homebrewtalk.com/f81/edworts-apfelwein-33986/>.

This takes the original recipe and substitutes dark DME in place of corn sugar, and a weizen yeast and Lactobacillus strain to provide a germanic fermentation with a touch of sour. Likewise, it is expected that this brew should be served sparkling rather than still. For convenience 7 bottles of 96 fl oz apple juice were used so the volume is actually 5.25 gallons rather than the conventional 5 gallons.
