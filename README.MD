# Gastronomic

A collection of recipes and gastronomic reflections

## About

I like cooking. I don't always like writing down detailed recipes, yet sometimes I do anyway. Herein is a mix of both. Unless otherwise noted, these are recipes I prepare from time to time and have occasionally been asked to share. I'm not sure exactly what my intention is with this repository other than having an easy way to get ahold of and share my own gastronomic reflections. Maybe one day I'll auto generate a printable recipe book or cards via a CICD pipeline, but for the moment you're welcome to peruse various markdown files for tasty eats.

P.S. I'm happy to get Pull-Requests or Issues for corrections, updates, or even just your own gastronomic reflections.
