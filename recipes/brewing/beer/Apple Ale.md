# Apple Ale

5 gallon partial mash

_Based on Midwest Supplies [Apple Ale <http://www.midwestsupplies.com/apple-ale.html>](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/apple-ale.html) (item 789x) as a base, but using more fermentables including DME and 1 gallon pasteurized cider at primary fermentation._

This recipe was enjoyed by typical non-beer drinkers. It was almost cider like and packed quite the punch.
