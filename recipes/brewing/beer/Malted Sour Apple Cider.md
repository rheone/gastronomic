# Malted Sour Apple Cider

\*A no boil malted cider based on [EdWort's Apfelwein <https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/edworts-apfelwein.33986/>](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/edworts-apfelwein.33986/).

This takes the original recipe and substitutes dark DME in place of corn sugar, and weizen yeast + Lactobacillus strain to provide a Germanic fermentation with a touch of sour. Likewise, it is expected that this brew should be served sparkling rather than still. For convenience 7 bottles of 96 fl oz apple juice were used so the volume is actually 5.25 gallons rather than the conventional 5 gallons.

This was quite tasty, but maybe a bit overly sweet.
