> A basic Neapolitan pizza dough is simple: combine flour, water, salt, and yeast, knead it a bit, let it rise at least overnight, form it into balls, allow them to rise, stretch, and top. Taking the weight of the **flour as 100%**, I add **60% water**, **2% salt**, and **1% yeast**. That breaks down to 10 ounces (two cups) of flour, six ounces of water, one teaspoon of kosher salt, and a half teaspoon of yeast for around three pizza crusts.

- 10% 1:1 starter of flour total
- 2% salt
- 1.5% sugar
- 60% water
- Bread flour (560g ~ 6-10 in crust)
