# Dinner Rolls

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour, or more if needed
- 1 envelope Active Yeast
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

- 1/4 cup water
- 2 tablespoons butter

## Preparation

1. Combine 3/4 cup flour, undissolved yeast, sugar and salt in a large bowl.

1. Add milk mixture to flour mixture.
1. Beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally.
1. Add 1/4 cup flour; beat 2 minutes at high speed. Stir in enough remaining flour to make soft dough.

1. Remove from pan; brush with additional melted butter, if desired. Serve warm.
