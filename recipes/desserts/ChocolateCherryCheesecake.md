# Chocolate Cherry Cheesecake

This "light" cheesecake isn't as heavy as New York cheesecake, but still plenty worth the time if not the calories. The cherries pair wonderfully with both the chocolate and almonds, but there is no reason another fruit or curd couldn't be used as an alternate topping.
