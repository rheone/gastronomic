# Overly Complex Chocolate Chip Cookies

**DRAFT** _2020-12-20T21:30:00Z_ **This recipe is under development**, as such, even as far as internet recipes are concerned, it comes with fewer guarantees than most. The hope is to eventually find the right balance, but that will take some experimentation before that happens.

These cookies are intended to satisfy brown sugar cravings as well as placate a bit of the desire for saltiness. The roasted sugar should build a nice structure non-overly sweet caramel flavor that builds compliments the present Bourbon and with vanilla. The toasted oat flour should add both a hint of nuttiness and a silky-chewy texture that the brown sugar itself can't provide. A variety of texture and flavor is intended by using both semisweet chocolate chunks paired with dark chocolate chips. Finally, brown butter is the key element to make the sum worthy of all its parts. Note that the cookie dough is intended to rest for at least 24 hours before baking.

This recipe is purposely complex, not in order to scare people away, but rather to prove that complexity does not have equate to difficulty. Time, and intention are key ingredients to these Overly Complex Chocolate Chip Cookies.

-  3 1/2 oz roasted sugar (or granulated white sugar; see preparation)
-  3 oz toasted oat flour (or old-fashioned rolled oats; see preparation)
-  5 3/4 oz unbleached all-purpose flour
-  1/2 tsp baking soda
-  14 tbs unsalted butter divided (brown butter)
-  5 1/4 oz fresh dark brown sugar
-  1 tsp salt
-  1 tbs vanilla extract (not imitation, never imitation)
-  2 tbs Bourbon
-  1 large egg
-  1 large egg yolk
-  4 oz semisweet chocolate chunks
-  4 oz dark chocolate chips

## Preparation

### Roasted Sugar

Roast sugar using the [Stella Parks Roasted Sugar](https://food52.com/recipes/72233-roasted-sugar) method. In this process much more roasted sugar than is needed will be made for the recipe, but it is versatile and stores well. Don't attempt to scale down too far.

Roasted sugar should be prepared well ahead of the cookie recipe.

1. Preheat oven to 325°F
1. Add at least 3 lbs **granulated white sugar** to a glass or ceramic baking dish such that it is at least 3/4 inch deep with a uniform depth
1. Bake stirring well every 20 to 30 minutes
1. Bake for at least 3 hours, but up to 5 for a richer flavor
1. Allow to cool away from moisture as the sugar is hygroscopic and will adsorb errant water
1. Once cooled it may be desirable to sift thoroughly through a course strainer for uniformity and removal of lumps
1. Store extra sugar in a sealed container

### Toasted Oat Flour

Toasted oar flour may be prepared ahead of cookie recipe so that it may be added in a cooled state.

1. Begin with more than the desired final weight of **old-fashioned rolled oats** as toasting process can reduce moisture
1. Add oats to pre-heated dry skillet
1. mix constantly until golden brown with a nutty aroma
1. In food processor or blender grind into a fine flour

### Cookie Dough

1. Prepare 2 baking sheets with parchment
1. Whisk together **toasted oat flour**, **unbleached all-purpose flour**, and **baking soda**
1. Prepare brown butter
   -  Melt 10 tbs **unsalted butter** in a pan with a large bottom surface area
   -  Continue cooking and mixing butter until it is golden brown with a nutty aroma
   -  Immediately remove brown butter, including solids, from pan placing in a heat proof container stirring in the remaining 4 tbs **unsalted butter** to arrest any further cooking.
   -  Allow to cool, but not solidify
1. Prepare wet ingredients
   -  Combine **brown butter**, **roasted sugar**, **dark brown sugar**, **salt**, **vanilla extract**, **Bourbon** and creme until incorporated and no lumps remain
   -  Add **egg** and additional **egg yolk** incorporate until smooth
   -  Allow to rest for 3 to 5 minutes before and work again for approximately 30 seconds. Repeat rest and work a couple of times until mixture becomes thick, smooth, and glossy. This allows the sugar to properly dissolve in the mixture
1. Combine flour mixture with wet ingredients until just combined
1. Add **semisweet chocolate chunks** and **dark chocolate chips**
1. **Allow dough to rest for at least 24 hours** in the refrigerator in an air tight container

### Cookie Baking

1. Preheat oven to 375°F with a central oven rack
1. Make balls from approximately 3 tbs of dough placed bake 2 inches apart
1. Sprinkle dough balls with a bit of **course finishing salt**
