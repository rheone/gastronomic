# Overly Complex Chocolate Chip Cookies

**DRAFT** _2020-12-25_ - This recipe is under development, as such, even as far as internet recipes are concerned, it comes with fewer guarantees than most. The hope is to eventually find the right balance, but that will take some experimentation before that happens.

These cookies are intended to satisfy brown sugar cravings as well as placate a bit of the desire for saltiness. They rely heavily on the Maillard reaction to find cookie bliss. Roasted sugar should build a nice structure and provide a non-overly sweet caramel/toffy flavor that compliments the Bourbon and with vanilla. Toasted oat flour provides both a hint of nuttiness and a silky-chewy texture that the brown sugar itself can't provide. A variety of texture and flavor is intended by using both chocolate chunks and chips. Finally, brown butter and a finishing of salt brings it all together. Note that the cookie dough is intended to rest for at least 12 to 24 hours before baking, this exercise in patience is worth it.

This recipe is purposely complex. That complexity however is reflected in flavor, not the skills needed to make cookies. Yes, there are many steps, but not a one of them is difficult. Time, and intention are key ingredients to these Overly Complex Chocolate Chip Cookies. This recipe is heavily inspired by both the works of J. Kenji L처pez-Alt<sup>1</sup> and America's Test Kitchen<sup>2</sup>.

## Ingredients

-  3 1/2 oz roasted sugar (made with granulated white sugar; see preparation below)
-  3 oz toasted oat flour (made with old-fashioned rolled oats; see preparation below)
-  5 3/4 oz unbleached all-purpose flour
-  1/2 tsp baking soda
-  7 oz unsalted butter divided (brown butter)
-  5 1/4 oz fresh dark brown sugar
-  1 tsp salt
-  1 tbs vanilla extract <sup>2</sup>
-  2 tbs Bourbon <sup>3</sup>
-  1 large egg
-  1 large egg yolk
-  4 oz semisweet chocolate chunks
-  4 oz dark chocolate chips
-  course finishing salt

## Preparation

### Roasted Sugar

Roast sugar using the Stella Parks Roasted Sugar method<sub>4</sup>. In this process much more roasted sugar than is needed will be made for the recipe, but it is versatile and stores well. Don't attempt to scale down too far.

Roasted sugar should be prepared well ahead of the cookie recipe.

1. Preheat oven to 325째F
1. Add at least 3 lbs **granulated white sugar** to a glass or ceramic baking dish such that it is at least 3/4 inch deep with a uniform depth
1. Bake sugar, stirring well every 20 to 30 minutes
1. Total bake should last for at least 3 hours, but up to 5 for a richer flavor and darker color
1. Allow roasted sugar to cool away from moisture as the sugar is hygroscopic and will adsorb errant water
1. Once cooled it may be desirable to sift thoroughly through a course sieve for uniformity and removal of possible lumps
1. Store extra sugar in a sealed container

### Toasted Oat Flour

Toasted oat flour may be prepared ahead of cookie recipe

1. Begin with more than the desired final weight of **old-fashioned rolled oats** as toasting process can reduce moisture
1. Add oats to pre-heated dry skillet
1. Keep the oats constantly moving until they become golden brown with a nutty aroma
1. Allow toasted oats to cool to room temperature
1. In food processor, blender, or even a coffee grinder grind the toasted oats into a fine flour

### Cookie Dough

1. Prepare 2 baking sheets with parchment
1. Sift and whisk together **toasted oat flour**, **unbleached all-purpose flour**, and **baking soda**
1. Prepare brown butter
   -  Melt 5 oz **unsalted butter** in a pan with on medium-low heat
   -  Continue to cook butter continuously stirring until it is golden brown with a nutty aroma
   -  Immediately remove brown butter, including solids, from pan placing in a heat proof container stirring in the remaining 2 oz **unsalted butter** to cool and arrest any further cooking.
   -  Allow to cool completely
1. Prepare wet ingredients
   -  Combine cooled **brown butter**, **roasted sugar**, **dark brown sugar**, **salt**, **vanilla extract**, and **Bourbon**. Cream mixture until incorporated and no lumps remain
   -  Add **egg** and additional **egg yolk** to mixture and incorporate until smooth
   -  Allow to rest for 3 to 5 minutes before and work again for approximately 30 seconds. Repeat rest and work a couple of times until mixture becomes thick, smooth, and glossy. This allows the sugar to properly dissolve in the mixture
1. Combine flour mixture with wet ingredients until just combined
1. Add **semisweet chocolate chunks** and **dark chocolate chips**
1. **Allow dough to rest for at least 24 hours** in the refrigerator in an air tight container

### Cookie Baking

1. Preheat oven to 375째F with a central oven rack
1. Make dough balls from approximately 3 tbs each of cookie dough
1. For added texture tear each dough ball in half and sticking sticking the smooth sides back together with the rough sides facing outward
1. Bake one cookie sheet at a time for 10 to 14 minutes, rotating cookie sheet 180 degrees at the half way point
1. Lightly sprinkle still warm cookies with a bit of **course finishing salt**
1. Allow cookies to cool on a wire rack and store in an air tight container

3. The **Stella Parks** [Roasted Sugar (https://food52.com/recipes/72233-roasted-sugar)](https://food52.com/recipes/72233-roasted-sugar) Method turns the simple sweetness of granulated white sugar into something much more complex and favorable.
4. Vanilla is an important ingredient, I'd highly recommend using real vanilla extract over the cheaper imitation extract, however beyond that the fanciest and most expensive varietal is often unnecessary in baked goods.
5. The Bourbon is an agent of flavor and chaos in these cookies it is not necessary to use simply flavorful. If you don't care for Bourbon, Amaretto is one of many alternative options
