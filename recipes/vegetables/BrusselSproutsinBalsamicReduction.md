# Brussels Sprouts in Balsamic Reduction

From Shannon

## Ingredients

-  Bacon (optional)
-  Balsamic vinegar
-  brussels Sprouts
-  Butter
-  Garlic
-  Olive oil
-  Pepper
-  Salt
-  Shallot

## Preparation

1. Preheat oven to 375
1. Finely chop a shallot and saute in some butter or olive oil, optionally with garlic.
1. Drain the oil/butter and set aside.
1. Heat 1/3 - 1/2 cup (whatever looks like enough) balsamic vinegar at a low simmer for 30 minutes (with the shallot mix, if desired).
1. Stir occasionally and generally keep an eye on it (it can become charcoal very easily).
1. Let it thicken to where it can coat the back of a spoon. It won't get terribly thick unless it's cooled.
1. Trim the stems and cut brussels sprouts in half.
1. Toss sprouts with olive oil (enough to coat the brussels sprouts but not to leave any standing in the bottom of the pan)
1. Add salt, and pepper (to taste).
1. Bake until soft, with some crispy outer leaves (about 50 minutes). (you can also add some diced, pre (softly) cooked bacon at this stage).
1. Once the brussels sprouts are done, remove them from the oven and toss them with the balsamic reduction over low heat until coated.
